# AI-assistant-Notion
The AI Assistant for Notion is a personal project aimed at creating an AI-powered assistant that integrates with Notion to help me manage my tasks, notes, and projects more efficiently. The assistant will be able to understand natural language inputs, respond accordingly, and perform tasks such as creating new pages and sections in Notion.
